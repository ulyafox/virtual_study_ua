							Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts,

							On December 21, 1891, Naismith published rules for a new game using five basic ideas and thirteen rules. 
							That day, he asked his class to play a match in the Armory Street court: 9 versus 9, using a soccer ball 
							and two peach baskets. Frank Mahan, one of his students, wasn't so happy. He just said: "Harrumph. Another new game"

							There were many physical education teachers in the army that knew the 
							game so they played it wherever they went.

						Only five players per team on the court.
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						In the NBA, WNBA, and NCAA basketball, each team can play a 
						maximum number of five players on the court. If a team breaks 
						this main rule, they will lose possession of the ball. 
						Sometimes this inadvertently happens, particularly at low 
						levels of the game, when substitute players check into the 
						game and others don't leave the court in time.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="rules__container__singlerule">
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Score more than your opponent to win.
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						To win the game, a team 
						must score more field goals than the other team. A field goal 
						refers to any basket a player scores during gameplay. Field 
						goals can be worth two or three points. Field goals shot from 
						inside the arc that designates the three-point line on the court 
						are worth two points. Field goals shot from outside the arc are 
						worth three points. Field goals can take the form of jump shots, 
						layups, slam dunks, and tip-ins.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="rules__container__singlerule">
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Score within the shot clock.
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						Teams have a limited amount of time 
						to shoot the ball during a given possession. In the NBA and WNBA, 
						teams are allowed 24 seconds of possession before they must shoot, 
						while NCAA teams are allowed 30 seconds. A shot clock mounted above 
						the hoop on each side of the court displays and counts down the time 
						allotted. If the shot clock elapses, the opposing team forfeits the 
						ball and becomes the defensive team.

					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Dribbling advances the ball. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						Basketball players may only advance the 
						ball by passing or dribbling (bouncing the ball on the floor) as 
						they move up and down the court. If a player stops dribbling, they 
						may not resume; instead, they must pass the ball or shoot it. If an 
						offensive player with possession of the ball stops then continues 
						dribbling before passing or shooting, the referee will call a “double 
						dribble,” and the opposing team gets the ball. Additionally, players 
						may only advance the ball by dribbling it. If they run while holding 
						the ball, they are traveling. Referees will issue a traveling call, 
						and possession of the ball will go to the opposing team.

						The offense has five seconds to inbound the ball. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						After the offense 
						scores a basket, the opposing team receives possession of the ball. 
						One of their players has to inbound the ball from a designated spot 
						on the sidelines of the court to resume gameplay. The player has 
						five seconds to pass the ball to another player on his team, or else 
						the team loses possession. The defender cannot contact the ball when 
						the offensive player is trying to inbound it, or the referee can 
						issue a technical foul.

					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						The offense must advance the ball. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						Once an offensive team advances 
						the ball past the half-court line, the ballhandler may not cross that 
						line again, or a referee will award possession of the ball to the 
						opposing team.

						Ball and ballhandler must remain inbounds. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						During gameplay, the 
						player with possession of the ball must stay within the designated 
						inbounds lines marked on the court. If a player steps out of bounds 
						or touches this line with their foot while holding the ball, the 
						referee will award possession to the opposing team. Additionally, 
						if a player shoots the ball while their foot is touching the line 
						and the shot is successful, it will not count.

					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Defenders can’t interfere with a shot on a downward trajectory. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						After the offensive player shoots the ball, it is illegal for a 
						defensive player to interfere with it once it begins its descent 
						toward the rim. This interference is called a goaltend and will 
						result in an automatic field goal for the offense.

					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Defenders can legally block or steal the ball. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						The defending team’s 
						goal is to prevent the offensive team from scoring by either stealing 
						the ball, blocking the ball from entering the basket, or using 
						defensive tactics to prevent an offensive player from shooting and 
						scoring.

						Defenders must leave the paint after three seconds. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						The area directly 
						in front of the basket is sometimes referred to as "the paint" or 
						"inside the key." Offensive players may not camp out in this area 
						waiting for the ball or an offensive rebound. Any individual player 
						can spend a maximum of three seconds at a time in the space before 
						they have to move. Once they step out of the paint, they can return. 
						If the referee notices a player hovering in the paint for over three 
						seconds, the team will receive a three-second violation.

					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Each team is allotted a certain number of fouls. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						The NBA allows each 
						team a total of five fouls per quarter. Once a team surpasses this 
						allotment, they go “into the bonus,” which means the officials will 
						award the opposing team with free throws for every additional foul 
						that a player commits in that quarter of play. In the NCAA, these 
						foul shots are known as "one and one" shots, which means that if a 
						player makes the first free throw, they receive a second free throw. 
						If they miss the first free throw, either team can rebound the errant 
						shot and claim possession. After 10 team fouls, the opposing team 
						gets a "double bonus," which means they get to take two foul shots.

					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Illegal contact results in a personal foul. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						A personal foul is an 
						infraction that violates the rules of the game. Players can incur 
						personal fouls by pushing, blocking, or striking another player in 
						the act of shooting. Shooting fouls result in free throw attempts for 
						the fouled player. If a defender fouls a shooter attempting a two-point 
						shot, the shooter will receive two free throws. If a shooter is 
						fouled during a three-point shot attempt, they will receive three 
						free throws. If the player makes the shot they were attempting at 
						the time of illegal contact, the basket counts, and the shooter 
						will receive one free throw.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="rules__container__singlerule">
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Excessive contact results in a flagrant foul. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						Flagrant fouls refer 
						to a personal foul that can potentially injure the opponent. These 
						fouls carry heavier penalties, such as fines, immediate ejection, 
						and even suspension. There are two types of flagrant fouls: flagrant 
						foul—penalty (1) and flagrant foul—penalty (2). Flagrant 1 refers to 
						fouls involving unnecessary contact. The penalty for this foul type 
						is a free throw for the opponent and possession of the ball. Flagrant 
						2 refers to any foul involving unnecessary and excessive contact. 
						Officials perform an instant-play review to determine if an act 
						qualifies for the flagrant 2 penalty. If it does, the player at fault 
						is assessed a fine and an automatic ejection from the game, and the 
						opposing team receives free throws and possession of the ball.

					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Charges and illegal screens result in an offensive foul. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						An offensive 
						foul is a personal foul that offensive players commit when their 
						team possesses the ball. The two most common offensive fouls are 
						charging and illegal ball screens. Charging is when an offensive 
						player makes contact with a defensive player who has planted their 
						feet in a locked position. An illegal screen is when a 
						non-ball-handling offensive player moves while setting a screen 
						for their teammate to prevent the defender from moving about the 
						court.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="rules__container__singlerule">
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__title">
						Certain rule violations result in technical fouls. 
					</div>
					<div class="rules__container__singlerule__content">
						A technical 
						foul is a penalty for violating the game’s administrative rules. 
						Officials commonly assess technical fouls for fighting and verbal 
						abuse, often assessing coaches with this penalty if they are too 
						abrasive when disputing a call. Technical fouls result in a free 
						throw and a change of possession. If a player or coach receives two 
						technical fouls in the same game, the referee will eject them. 
						Players with a long history of technical fouls risk suspension 
						from the regular season and even playoff games.
